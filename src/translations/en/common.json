A graduate in Systems Analysis and Development from Estácio in 2023, my background allows me to apply solid design principles and develop effective REST APIs. I have previous experience as a Frontend Developer at Citifyd, where I participated in the refactoring of systems from AngularJS to React, and at Suitable, where I developed functionalities and rewrote systems using Next.js. I am always looking to learn new technologies and tools to offer innovative and efficient solutions.",

I've also worked on the development of the institutional website at the company, using Next.JS, CSS modules, TypeScript, and Storybook.",
