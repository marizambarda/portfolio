    "aboutMe": "Currently, I work as a Frontend Engineer at [Events], where I contribute to the development and improvement of solutions focused on React and Capacitor. A graduate in Systems Analysis and Development from Estácio in 2023, my background allows me to apply solid design principles and develop effective REST APIs. I have previous experience as a Frontend Developer at Citifyd, where I participated in the refactoring of systems from AngularJS to React, and at Suitable, where I developed functionalities and rewrote systems using Next.js. I am always looking to learn new technologies and tools to offer innovative and efficient solutions.",
    "citifydProjects": "One of the main projects I've been working on is the refactor of Citifyd's parking provider Dashboard from Angular.js to React. In these projects, we refactored the entire system, and implemented Storybook with the creation of reusable components, in addition to the creation of unit tests. I've also worked on the development of the institutional website at the company, using Next.JS, CSS modules, TypeScript, and Storybook.",

The platform makes it easier for drivers to find and purchase parking, for parking providers to offer available spaces, and for nearby businesses to attract customers locally. At Citifyd, I worked on the maintenance and development of new features using front-end technologies such as React and Next.js. My contributions included the incremental migration of the Parking Provider Dashboard from legacy AngularJS to React to ensure long-term maintainability while keeping the system fully operational, the implementation of a reusable component library in TypeScript using Storybook with accompanying unit tests, the development of a B2B-focused website with a strong emphasis on SEO using Next.js, CSS Modules, and modern front-end practices, and the creation of dashboard features such as dynamic event-based pricing, enabling automatic price adjustments based on transaction volume and time remaining until events.",

During my time at the company, there was no development of new features, bug fixing, or refactoring of the restaurant's control panel code, developed in React. I also participated in the complete rewriting of the website, migrating from PHP to Next.js.",
